# CaparzoLanguage
This is a final project for Organización de computadores at EAFIT University. 

This project was made by: Armando Ríos Gallego and Julián Ríos Vasquéz

To use this toy language you have to install Node Js and run the command "npm install" to install the required modules.

Now this language can compile these grammar rules.
# Note: this language doesn't have loops and doesn't work with string, only works with numbers ¡¡¡¡PLEASE NAME THA FILE "Main.capz"!!!!

to declare a variable and initialize it:

var_name => expression

expression=> fun_call| number | identifier

fun_call => fun_name (argList)
# Math functions
add(num,num2)

sub(num,num2)

multiply(num,num2)

divide(num,num2)

# Draw functions

to draw a rectangle, line and circle

rectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2)

line(x1,y1,x2,y2)

circle(x,y,r)

# Example "Main.capz"
num = 50

num1 = add(125,sub(num,25))

printInt(num1)

circle(20,30,5)

# How to execute the compiler
after run npm install now you can run

node run.js Main.capz

The console will print 

Wrote Main.ast.
Wrote Main.vm.

The Main.vm can be use in the VMEmulator of Nandtotetris
